# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.

## Overview

This project analyzes time series data from the freeCodeCamp forum, tracking daily page views from May 2016 to December 2019.

The goal is to visualize long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and overall growth using structured data analysis techniques.

## Objectives

- Import and clean time series data using Pandas
- Remove statistical outliers (top and bottom 2.5%)
- Create visualizations to analyze trends and seasonality

## Visualizations

### 1. Line Plot
Displays daily page views over time to show overall growth trends.

### 2. Bar Plot
Shows average monthly page views grouped by year to highlight year-over-year growth.

### 3. Box Plots
- Year-wise Box Plot (Trend): Shows distribution of page views per year.
- Month-wise Box Plot (Seasonality): Shows monthly distribution across years.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py
